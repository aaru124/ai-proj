            <h2>What is Parkinson's Disease?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control. It is characterized by tremors, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and postural instability. The disease primarily results from the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain.

            <p>
                Parkinson's disease can significantly impact a person's daily life and quality of life. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can help manage its symptoms.

            <h2>What causes Parkinson's Disease?</h2>
            <p>
                The most prominent signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease occur when nerve cells in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain that controls movement, become impaired and/or die. Normally, these nerve cells, or neurons, produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. When the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine, which causes the movement problems associated with the disease. Scientists still do not know what causes the neurons to die.
            </p>
            <p>
                Experiencing these changes can be difficult, but support groups can help people cope. These groups can provide information, advice, and connections to resources for those living with Parkinson’s disease, their families, and caregivers. The organizations listed below can help people find local support groups and other resources in their communities.
